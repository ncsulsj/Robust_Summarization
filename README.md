# Towards a Robust Retrieval-Based Summarization System

This includes the original implementation of **Towards a Robust Retrieval-Based Summarization System** 

In this implementation, we encapsulate following (1) How to generate data through **SummRAG** (data_generation directory) (2) How to train Mistral 7B instruct v0.1 with LoRA on our curated dataset (model_training directory) (3) How to evaluate the model's performance with **LogicSumm** (model_evaluation directory) into this repo.
